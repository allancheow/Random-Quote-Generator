# Title
Treehouse Project #01  
	Random Quote Generator  
<br>

# Overview

For this first project, create an app which displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked.

_There is also an option to turn on an automatic change every five second_

Used my growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to:
 - Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.
 - Write functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
